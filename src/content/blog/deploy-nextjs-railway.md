Railway makes deploying Next.js applications incredibly simple. In this tutorial, we'll walk through deploying a Next.js app from GitHub to Railway in just a few minutes.

## Why Railway for Next.js?

Railway is perfect for Next.js because:
- **Automatic detection**: Railway automatically detects Next.js and configures the build
- **Zero configuration**: No need to set up complex build pipelines
- **Built-in CDN**: Your static assets are served from Railway's global CDN
- **Environment variables**: Easy management of secrets and config
- **Custom domains**: Free SSL certificates and custom domain support

## Prerequisites

Before we start, make sure you have:
- A Next.js project in a GitHub repository
- A Railway account ([sign up here](https://railway.app?referralCode=YOUR_CODE))

## Step 1: Push Your Next.js App to GitHub

If you don't have a Next.js app yet, create one:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-railway-app
cd my-railway-app
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/my-railway-app.git
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 2: Connect to Railway

1. Go to [Railway](https://railway.app?referralCode=YOUR_CODE) and sign up or log in
2. Click "New Project"
3. Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
4. Choose your Next.js repository
5. Click "Deploy Now"

That's it! Railway will automatically:
- Detect that it's a Next.js project
- Install dependencies with `npm install`
- Build your app with `npm run build`
- Start the server with `npm start`

## Step 3: Configure Environment Variables (Optional)

If your app uses environment variables:

1. Go to your project dashboard
2. Click on the "Variables" tab
3. Add your environment variables (like `DATABASE_URL`, `API_KEY`, etc.)
4. Railway will automatically restart your app with the new variables

## Step 4: Set Up Custom Domain (Optional)

Railway provides a free `.railway.app` domain, but you can add your own:

1. In your project dashboard, go to "Settings"
2. Click "Domains"
3. Add your custom domain
4. Update your DNS records as shown
5. Railway automatically provisions SSL certificates

## Step 5: Automatic Deployments

Every time you push to your main branch, Railway will:
- Automatically rebuild your app
- Deploy the new version
- Keep your app running with zero downtime

## Common Next.js Configurations

### Static Site Generation (SSG)

For static sites, add this to your `next.config.js`:

```javascript
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  output: 'export',
  trailingSlash: true,
  images: {
    unoptimized: true
  }
}

module.exports = nextConfig
```

### API Routes

Railway automatically handles Next.js API routes. Your endpoints will be available at:
- `https://your-app.railway.app/api/endpoint`

### Database Integration

Railway makes it easy to add databases:

1. Click "Add Service" in your project
2. Select "PostgreSQL" (or your preferred database)
3. Railway provides connection details automatically
4. Use the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable in your app

## Troubleshooting

### Build Failures

If your build fails, check:
- Your `package.json` scripts are correct
- All dependencies are listed in `package.json`
- Build logs in the Railway dashboard

### Performance Optimization

- Use Next.js Image Optimization
- Enable caching headers
- Consider using Railway's built-in CDN for static assets

## What's Next?

Now that your Next.js app is deployed, you can:
- Add a database with one click
- Set up monitoring and analytics
- Configure custom domains
- Scale your app automatically

Railway makes Next.js deployment effortless, so you can focus on building great applications instead of managing infrastructure.
